### 1. Multiscale analysis

#### Main capabilities 
1. Concurrent (FE2) Multiscale analysis of microscopically heterogeneous structures
2. Stress strain history analysis of heterogenous material models

#### Two scale transitions implementations
1. small and finite strains implementations for 3D problems
2. small strains 3D to 2D homogenizations
3. small strains 3D to Kirchhoff Love shell
4. thermal problems

#### Model General properties
Classes of the Msolve Constitutive project are also used to assign general model properites:
1. for dynamic analysis
2. steady state thermal problems
